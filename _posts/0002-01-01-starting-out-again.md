I imagined after the replacement of my hands and feet that I would never do much adventuring again. Well now here we are, and I've decided I'm going to write some of these things down so maybe one day I can read back on all the dumb things that have happened.
 
This particular adventure was helping some dirt farmer who had a missing chicken whose name I've thankfully forgotten. I do remember my strong feelings of hatred for it. I hated the farmer too.
 
Given this missing chicken could be literally anywhere - probably dead too - Illy decided it would be a good idea to climb the old mill in Queensdale to search for the vermin. When we got there she disappeared and left me to my own devices, which I took quite a bit of offense to at the time. It required a clever use of elemental magic to freeze various beams, gears, and other broken bits together to make a way up to the top, where Illy teleported to without me knowing. I suspect the entire purpose of the mill was to get me used to using magic again.
 
Regardless as to whether my feelings were heard, Illy spotted the chicken in the hands of three centaur some time after I got to the top of the mill. Great. Illy's handled far worse, she could kill three centaur without much trouble. She decided she needed my help though, grabbed me, and used a glider to get us to the southwest where the centaur were. I had mixed feelings about the whole situation but flying was pretty neat so I didn't say much.
 
When we got there I started envisioning the manner in which these things would wear my lower intestines as a set of scarves. Figuring I could talk myself out of a fight, I loudly proclaimed that Illy would kill them all if they didn't give up that stupid chicken. They didn't, because they're centaur and stupid.
 
Illy took two of them. I was left with the third, who had a bow. I had not been in any proper fight in six months by my recollection. I had a sword, and magic that I was still trying to get ahold of again. I curled into a ball, accepted my death, and somehow when he shot his arrow I didn't die. It did strike my metal prosthetics though, which was very distressing.  I got onto my feet, threw my sword at him, and came at him with fists. Fists, against a centaur. Thankfully the sword did most of the damage, and momentarily stunned by a sword being thrown into his chest gave me just enough time to get in a swing at his face.
 
To my surprise, lightning ran from my fingertips, and I began swinging faster than would be natural. On about the fifth swing, I took his jaw off. I screamed, he slumped to the ground. Illy ran to my side having already dispatched her two opponents probably before my bout even began. I hadn't killed anything that I would consider sentient in years. I panicked in no uncertain terms. With great help from Illy's comforting words, I sorted myself out, and we took the chicken back to the possibly probably most likely inbred farmer.
