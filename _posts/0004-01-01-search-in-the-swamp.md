This particular entry comes a few weeks after the events in the ice cave. Illy returns to the North and I inspect the contents of the crate opened by the key. I didn't really know its purpose, so I sought out Sif's opinion - her specialty being artifacts such as these.
 
In our brief conversation we caught the attention of a human named Kasielle. She has too many dresses and not enough practical clothing, but she's a decent enough Mesmer. The idea gathered from this brief meeting is simple: Talk to Grandma Sheerwood, who gave me the box, and determine its purpose. We set out into Godslost one day later.
 
The walk to Godslost was rather uneventful - though Kas proved herself to be surprisingly normal and even amiable in some respects. Sif was her usual self.
 
Godslost was how I left it - a stinking, sweltering mass of nothing important. Water, trees, flora, and dead things. Kas and I rode upon Sif when we began traversing dangerous terrain - mostly because I don't want to swim in a swamp and Kas had a dress. For a swamp trek. She noted she will be getting some more practical clothing which I think excuses her this one time.
 
All went well until we saw the cove in which Sheerwood makes her residence. There, we were attacked by Skelk. Six in total - the launched themselves at Sif, and I and Kas leapt into the water to avoid them. I didn't see most of what happened in the first few seconds. Kas grabbed me out of the water as I sunk into a swamp that reached the top of my head. As I was lifted up, it gave me just enough leverage to draw my sword, and use it as a focus to create a wave to surge water outwards and lower the levels such that I could stand, and not drown. The water left at my ankles, I quickly formed a lance of ice and skewered a skelk opposite me as Sif fought off quite a few of them. Then, as the water began to surge back to us, I unleashed a barrage of those same sorts of lances at another Skelk just as Kas was bitten by one of them and taken into the water below.
 
The Skelk that first attacked died immediately, much to my satisfaction. I struck out to attack the Skelk that went after Kas, but I only grazed it. At this same moment, it seems as though Kas teleported onto dry(er) land, and Sif managed to grab ahold of the monster as I made my way over to her.
 
We spent quite a while merely collecting ourselves, as Kas was wounded and I kind of wanted to just go home and crawl into bed. But, we were here for a reason and it felt like poor form to stop upon the doorstep of success.
 
We stepped through the threshold, and there before us was Grandma Sheerwood, among a large murder of crows. Hundreds of them. Greetings are exchanged - Kas is horrified by the humanoid skulls and rotting head surrounding the place (I don't look at them). So begins a long conversation, though I think that should be left for conversation, and not for writing.
