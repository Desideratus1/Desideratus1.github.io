The journal I retrieved was translated relatively quickly, though certainly not by me. I've bothered to get myself to the point where I can read some basic Jotun runes, but frankly I have golems to do most of that work for me so I'm not going to learn the entire language. Anyway here's the useful, skimmed down information from the journal.

The Jotun Sorcerer whose creations we've been dealing with built a workshop in a "Land of always spring" somewhere in the Shiverpeaks. I was able to find and confirm the location of its entrance in a hot spring areas in the northern Shiverpeaks, along with several still-standing stelae which if my assumptions are correct, would lead to the realms that contain the other tarot cards.

In regards to the tarot cards, each card is like a key that opens a magic door to the realm it's linked to. For instance, The Tower card links to The Tower realm. The Jotun Sorcerer created a master key/card that presumably opened up to every single realm.

The Jotun Sorcerer used a shit ton of life, blood, and magic to get what he wanted. He probably killed a lot of people and he was probably really fucking powerful.

His early attempts to creating constructs like The Jailer ended in failure, though iterative attempts would eventually lead to the Jailer and the other tarot card figures. Each of the resulting twenty-one constructs would be created presumably with their own realm to house them[^fn-realms], and each of them given a particular purpose[^fn-purpose]. The constructs, one by one, would eventually fall into some form of violent depravity and rebel against their Jotun master. His "children" rebelling and falling into some unexplained madness, he destroyed his workshop and broke the entrance to lock everything away. He would disappear and presumably he is now dead (more on this later) somewhere, and only all 21 cards can open up the way to get to this dead Jotun.

He stated that when he attempted to kill the Jailer, the card ripped apart. Apparently he wasn't strong enough to kill the Jailer, which I managed to do. Either I'm stronger than the Jotun Sorcerer or his overreliance on magic is what fucked him. This leads me to believe that anti-magical abilities will be showing up in a lot of places. I should get a bigger gun.

Thus ends the useful information from the journal. My thoughts on it are as follows. The Jotun Sorcerer's loss of control is a classic example of the problem of free will. The tarot card entities were essentially progeny taught morality exclusively by an asshole that used blood, life, and magic to fix all of his problems before they rebelled. I could see that disaster coming from a mile away. 

On the other hand, I feel like the last few years of my life have been spent taking down gods with sticks and rocks. The requirements in magical resources and finesse to construct one Mists realm worth a damn is so ridiculously beyond my resources to replicate that I don't see a point in even trying. I'm getting tired of being told to bring down a castle wall and the best I get is a stick that's a bit sharp and a rock that's a bit big. For once in my life I want to be adequately prepared for the bullshit I have to deal with.

And on the third hand, based on some other notes I've found it looks like this Jotun was only able to do this shit because he got extraordinarily lucky and found some meteorites to put magic into or whatever the fuck. Which definitely pisses me off because this is all just clear evidence that your or my success is the placement of celestial bodies colliding with the planet, and sure as hell not our intelligence or abilities.

If the above rambling was confusing to you I'll condense it: The only thing I've done for the last few years is go up against people that stumbled into success and turned out evil and/or stupid.

Anyway onto the meat of this fucking report. This is a copy of what I sent to Calypso following my excursion into the Jotun Sorcerer's workshop. I'd give spoiler warnings but I don't want to so fuck you. The Jotun's name is Dhergos[^fn-name].


AGENT: me

TIME OF SUBMISSION: late

SUBJECT: fucked up workshop with evil asshole

SUBMISSION IDENTIFICATION: you figure it out, I'm not your secretary

I found Dhergos's workshop entrance buried in a hot spring surrounded by stelae that are probably entrances to the other tarot card realms. Getting into the workshop requires you spill blood onto a big-as-fuck tablet and then putting a shit ton of magic into it.

I got Hisa to open it up with a carved up owl or whatever and we went in. Place is fucked. There's a bridge, and then after the bridge is a burned up shitty little collection of buildings surrounding a central square where some burned up books are. Only two of them were salvageable, once more proving that Dhergos's supposed prowess only works when he ruins something.

Anyway the whole thing is surrounded by an ocean of blood because this guy just can't find different fucking motifs. Also there's an evil centipede thing living in the blood and shooting it in the head releases gems that hold a lot of magic. The centipede is probably the reason why the whole workshop area is devoid of magic. Also there's a bridge leading to a castle that's been destroyed. That's where "The Empress" and "The Emperor" are/were.

Apparently Hisa found a map or some shit and all the realms are connected somehow so yea. That's a thing.

I walked into the kitchen and Atros was just stood in the corner like some weirdo so that's how I found him. We talked for a bit. Dhergos said he didn't make Atros judging by the translated letters but I'm willing to bet that Atros was formed by Dhergos somehow. Maybe subconsciously. The implications of how Atros is "Dhergos but unchained" might give some insight into why the tarot card entities are such rabid assholes. Anyway I found out these things.

- Dhergos is dead (wow).
- Dhergos has a master key/card/whatever that can get you into the other realms.
- The only way to get to Dhergos and the master card is to collect all 21 other cards. So even in death that asshole makes my life more difficult.
- Atros has a tarot card: The Devil. He'll kill your friends and loved ones in exchange for helping you. There's some connection between him "unfettering" you from your chains and what Dhergos wrote in the journal but I haven't given that too much thought.
- Atros can call the centipede? They're made of the same blue starry translucent stuff but the centipede has a red bone skeleton.

Anyway eventually he refused to answer my questions so he sent the centipede after us. Hisa shot it and a gem fell out of its face which was pretty magicy. Tried to grab it but I couldn't and eventually we just got the fuck out of there. I called Erebus dad again and he hated it so I'm going to keep doing it.



[^fn-realms]: I'm currently under the suspicion that these realms are not strictly isolated, and upon their creation this was a single, unified realm.
[^fn-purpose]: What exactly the purpose of these things is, is unclear. The Jailer was created to "House the evils of the world" or something like that.
[^fn-name]: Stupid name.
