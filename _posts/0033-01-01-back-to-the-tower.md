Alright so it's been a few months before I've updated this in general and even longer since I visited "The Tarot" so I'll give a quick summary of the previous events.

Some Jotun named Dhergos way back during the last dragon rising made a Mists realm and imbued a number of Tarot cards with excessive amounts of magic. The cards eventually fell to some kind of "madness"[^fn-madness]. Dhergos also did a bunch of evil experiment shit and chained those evil experiments to the bottom of a lake of blood. Then he wrote in his journal about how surprising and terrifying it was that his creations turned on each other/him, chained himself up in a tomb that you can only open if you have all 22 cards, and then he died I guess.

Yea.

Fast forward to our time one of the subrealms owned by the card "The Tower" opened a portal into Tyria. I killed the entity bound to the card, left it, and then it was taken by some asshole called Titanshadow. Then we got into a war with him and it was real bad and then he basically won and sealed us out. Around the same time I left/was removed from Calypso because of some very big disagreements on if my worked belonged to me and other things like that.

Faster forward to now, the portal that first got us into the realms opened up again. I don't really have an explanation for how the portal in the Fields of Ruin opened up this time, but it did and the environment immediately surrounding the portal was kind of fucked up and burnt. Calypso being the ever enterprising chucklefucks sent in a group of some people to scout the place out and somehow[^fn-scouts] they never came back so Calypso sent in the C team to get them back. I got tipped off that this was happening by someone in the company and decided that if I could get that magic Mists dagger back and potentially punch Keres Wargrave[^fn-wargrave] in the face while doing it then I sure as hell wasn't going to pass up the opportunity. I loaded up on my usual kit. A revolver, some ammunition, and a sword. I also had in my possession three strips of paper which were imbued with a lot of a lot of anti-magic. You see, Wargrave's been wasted a few times now but some stubborn blood magic shit always brings her back. If I take away that magic and kill her, she's dead for good. These paper strips would be the key to not wasting my time in another "dead but not really" scenario.

So I waited in the distance some time until after the group went into the portal and then ran through while no one was looking. Security was thankfully lax that day, and I was met with the most interesting sight.

Alright so if you didn't read the previous chapters then the Mists realm changed a lot after Titanshadow took over, generally turning it into something that looks like Grothmar[^fn-grothmar]. Big fort in the distance, otherwise open terrain. But, some new additions were a dead sun in the sky giving off a hell of a lot of... Solar magic I guess? And next to the portal within the realm was a pyre of burning bodies stacked pretty high. Also everyone was fighting shadow creatures, except for one of the troop who was going up against Wargrave on her own and losing pretty badly.

I would like to state for the record for everyone that Keres tried to ambush me in my home a few months previous. I had no support, no way out, and I won. No one else can match me on that.

Anyway I ignored everything else and shot straight for Wargrave. I didn't see the dagger on her unfortunately but getting revenge on her was good enough for me so I went ahead with the plan. Clever use of water magic let me jump on her back without her noticing[^fn-notice] and I slapped on those three runic papers. Each one needed a quick charge of magic and Wargrave was up and moving around so hanging onto her armor and doing all of this wasn't that easy, but it worked all the same. As the third paper stuck to Keres's armor her magic was all but gone and I went in for the kill.

Except I didn't get my kill because the other Calypso operatives decided to finally get their shit together and they all descended on her before I could get the fucking chance. I hit her with my sword though and she saw me before she died so I hope her last moments were spent figuring out what I did and how I essentially killed her some paper and a good grip. Either way Keres was beaten to death and then the now-one-armed Calypso operative finished her off with some whack ass ritual spell or something.

And then I poked around a bit at the bonfire of bodies, shot a few shadow people in the distance and then left.


[^fn-madness]: Dhergos made them out of souls, blood, and bone in much the same way an evil necromancer would. Super surprising that they turned out to be crazy assholes.
[^fn-scouts]: They walked into a dangerous realm full of evil monsters, blood magic, and some asshole that blows up people's brains. Also super surprising they didn't come back.
[^fn-wargrave]: "The Warden". Essentially the right hand woman of whoever owns "The Tower". She stole my magic dagger and I kicked her ass a few times.
[^fn-grothmar]: Blood Legion homelands. Never been there and don't care to but apparently it's kind of nice if you get rid of all the awful shit the Charr have done to the place.
[^fn-notice]: Wargrave was currently in the process of taking off a Calypso operative's arm at the time. I would feel bad but I don't particularly like that operative either.
