So Keres Wargrave was killed. Nominally I wasn't part of Calypso anymore, but the new owner of the company liked me and disliked the current head of the group helming this Tarot shit to tell me to tag along. Also she tagged along too, which ended up being a terrible idea.

This time we were going in on a scouting mission. See what we can find, then get out. I was first and foremost foreboding about just running into the portal dick first when there was a very powerful Mesmer asshole owning the place but what do I know? I half expected the Mists side of the portal to be completely stacked with shadow creature warrior things and a line of rifles and pikes and other junk to be thrown at us once we crossed, but once we crossed over I saw naught before me but the usual burnt fields, burnt trees, the now dead pyre, and a couple twisting paths[^fn-idiot] that went over to some ruins and some mountains. That dead sun was still hanging where it was before, over the ruins which probably meant something to everyone else but just looked weird to me.

The mountains was where our destination was, so we took that path and it wasn't long before we ran into the foot of the mountain paths. The mountains were surrounded by a thick fog that was definitely magical, and as soon as we got into it things started to go wrong. You see, Lusine - the company head - is susceptible to getting possessed by Mists shit. The rest of us are too, but I guess Lusine is just super susceptible because as soon as we got into the fog, people started seeing things from their past or whatever and Lusine was just straight up a different person, telling us to take the castle and other useless information that tipped off she was fucked. Erebus then shot the fog for some reason and we all decided to split up.

Everyone else moved on while Harpp and myself stuck with Lusine. I don't know why, but for some fascinating reason Harpp thought he could just therapy off possession. Well that's a bit uncharitable I guess, but he sure as hell got nowhere fast. I, the scientist of the group and reasoning that one, the fog was the cause of Lusine's whack ass personality change and two, that the fog probably had something to do with it, I observed our surroundings. I noticed up the mountain there were a variety of strange, greenish-blackish torches stuck in the ground that seemed to ward away fog. Taking this in mind I summoned a bit of fire and held it next to Lusine to see if the spirit possessing her was warded away by fire. She swatted my hand and hissed at me[^fn-hiss].

Then Harpp fucking draws his up staff and tells me to go like he was about to attack me.

I can not tell you the amount of rage this caused me.

Anyway I fucked off and as I'm told Lusine immediately attacked Harpp and I could not possibly give less of a shit about whether or not he got hurt.

So I followed the trail that everyone else took and eventually found myself in a camp surrounded by those magic necromancer looking torches. I went up to one, it left the torch and tried to eat me, and I turned myself into fire. My fire and the necromancer fire mixed and I figured I was about to bite it but eventually the other fire died out so I guess that worked out for me.

I didn't really get a good look at the camp as the others were fighting some asshole on the mountainside and I had to quickly break the asshole's feet so they could capture her. I figured that was pointless to be honest but they seemed pretty adamant about it. I never really got a chance to look around in the camp or observe my surroundings, because after we secured said new prisoner we left. Harpp apparently or someone or whoever had apparently trapped Lusine in jade so that sorted that out. She was a mess for a few days afterwards. I would learn later that she was apparently possessed by "The Empress", one of the Tarot cards and what appears to be the strongest of the bunch. So that's something.

The only other thing left to talk about is the most important thing, what was beyond the mountains. You see, the camp that I never got a good look at was actually Titanshadow's camp - left almost completely unguarded like the portal site we entered the realm from[^fn-idiottwo]. Aside from that one asshole anyway. Therein was detailed a map of the general area, alchemagical blueprints, magical construct plans, locations and statuses of Tarot cards. Even more interesting was something that had nothing to do with this. The camp itself is positioned on an overlook, and looking down from the overlook was one massive magical stalemate.

Now, there used to be a big blood lake in the center of the realm. That blood lake was now dotted with massive crystals, and the blood is mixed with a beautiful stary blue sort of water. Mountains surrounded the lake. In the center of the lake is a gargantuan archway. In the archway, is a door made of stone covered in Jotun runes. Great beastial stary blue monsters rise from the lake and attack a number of shadow things like the ones from the previous chapter. The scale of the fighting was pretty damn big all things considered. Titanshadow himself was down there some ways leading the charge against the lake beasts.

So as you can see, shit was fucked. The stary monsters and the stary lake were probably on the side of the remaining Tarot cards and Titanshadow had fought all of them to a standstill. In the three months I had been trying to replicate Dhergos's work, Titanshadow took a half of a card and is now on the precipice of claiming the entire realm. I can't possibly describe to you how fucked we are. We're up against an army, and the amount of magic Titanshadow was throwing around down there was matched only by Verve[^fn-verve] a few years ago, and the Coalition at the height of its power backed up by Peacemakers, Wardens, and Seraph was barely kind of sort of a match.

I've been complaining about how bad this is for the last two weeks and if I do it anymore I'll have a heart attack, stroke, and aneurysm at the same time so I won't. As of this moment, I'm looking into weaponizing bloodstone to try to counteract the sheer amount of magic that Titanshadow is throwing around. As of current, the results are promising, but nowhere near on the scale required to take on said magic. It's not going great, and I'm digging around in the bottom of my "crazy bullshit" barrel to see what I can summon up. Let's hope it's good.

[^fn-idiot]: I guess we're lucky that Titanshadow is stupid.
[^fn-hiss]: It felt strange to be hissed at rather than me hissing.
[^fn-idiottwo]: Very lucky that Titanshadow is stupid.
[^fn-verve]: See A Record of Past Matters. The amount of magic that guy was chucking around was insane.
