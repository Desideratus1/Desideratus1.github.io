I was unable to retrieve the card.

Not long after our team exited the portal back into Tyria, Wargrave disintegrated, stating that "something was calling her". The portal shut, and was unable to be reopened. So I make another hole with the dagger in my possession, and found that The Tower had been altered entirely from its previous makeup to something entirely different. Where before we saw an old stone tower was now a Charr fortification. The card was found and taken by one of the residents left behind by the other team that went into the tower in the previous section.

What's more, in the next few days Wargrave would attack Calypso agents - starting with me. It was a damn near run thing being ambushed by her, but I managed to fight her off on my own. Tyrone was not so lucky, and found himself captured and spirited way to The Tower[^fn-wargraveattack].

A team was gathered with the express purpose of rescuing Tyrone[^fn-stupid1]. Doing this felt like an absolute waste of my time to be honest. We risk the entire team to rescue someone that could easily just be attacked by Wargrave a second time the moment he was brought back. This idea is a bandaid on a serious wound - the only way to fix this problem is to find the card and warp The Tower to our own image.

But Harpp was chosen as the leader. Not me. Orders were given out to open secret rifts into the realm, and we entered as stealthily as we could into a replica of Grothmar[^fn-stupid2]. Apparently the person that took the card had a penchant for primitive defenses. Sneaking in was rather easy - the sentinels placed upon the walls were creatures of shadow. Easy to dispatch with stealth. I nearly fell from the walls attempting to scale them but was thankfully caught by Harpp, and once we were upon the walls we split into two teams. One team would investigate the courtyard, and one - the team I was on - would investigate the prison, where Tyrone likely was.

To spoil the ending for you Tyrone had escaped and murdered a number of prisoners[^fn-stupid3] (Murderers and otherwise themselves), and was now on the run in the citadel. Reaching the prison was trivial for us but as Tyrone was nowhere to be seen, we decided to free the prisoners. I headed immediately for Wargrave's office, not bothering to stick around for the conversation with the prisoners that were still alive. Not like they would have any useful information. We did, however, find Roarke. Our previous quarry - so that's something at least.

I immediately found an intelligence document that listed Calypso's personnel and their strengths, weaknesses, and history. I also found a journal that I have since translated from the Jotun runes it was written in. The implications from it were disturbing but I won't include this in this section because that would be a hundred more paragraphs of scattered thoughts.

More importantly, I found what I thought was the card that the Jailer had left behind. In hindsight this was an obvious trap, but I saw the card and reached out for it on instinct. I was instantly hit with a spell of domination[^fn-stupid4]. And there to my side appeared Wargrave, probably laying in wait for this to happen[^fn-stupid5]. And so the domination spell broke through every contingency I put up like it was nothing, and commanded that I hand Wargrave the portal opening dagger.

And so I did. I don't remember exactly what happened after that. All I saw was red. I fought some weird creature with one of my team members as Wargrave made it to the top of the tower. Dispatching it was rather simple, and eventually made it to Wargrave who decided to spend a few seconds gloating as she opened a portal to what I assume to be the Shiverpeaks. This gloating proved to be a mistake, because god damn, did we fucking catch and thrash this piece of shit. The two Charr accompanying me managed to get into proper melee with her, while I teleported and grabbed onto one of her horns so I could ram my sword into and through her eye[^fn-good]. Wargrave, unable to now enter the portal she had just made, decided to throw herself off the tower with my holding onto her. This, she managed to do, but she neglected to understand that I'm an Elementalist. I turned myself into water before we hit the ground, and saved myself from a seven story fall onto hard stone. Wargrave wasn't so lucky, and upon impact was more or less pulped into twisted metal and meat. Unfortunately this wasn't exactly enough to kill her permanently[^fn-cannon], and while I was trying to recover, the blood from her body took the dagger and spirited it into the river where it was lost[^fn-stupid6].

Recovery after hitting the stone was difficult. Even as water the impact threw me into a daze from which would take a while to recover. And unable to walk on my own, my team carried me along as we reconnected with a freed Tyrone, who was apparently an eel or some shit. I don't know, I didn't bother looking into that. My dagger was gone, and everything beyond that I didn't too much of a damn about.

More important in the broader context is that Wargrave now has the ability to cut her way through the mists with the dagger. I suppose she already had this ability somehow, given her ability to attack me at Fort Fitzen. Still, Wargrave with this weapon was now even more dangerous, and the new owner of the card was by extension of this, also very dangerous. The stakes had been raised. No longer were we dealing with a more idle threat. This had turned into a race to unlock the secrets of the cards - yes, cards - before Wargrave and her master could. And we were already behind.



[^fn-wargraveattack]: Other Calypso agents would be contacted not long after Tyrone's capture and ordered into safe facilities with their families. I thought this was stupid and did not do this.
[^fn-stupid1]: I thought this was stupid.
[^fn-stupid2]: I thought this was stupid.
[^fn-stupid3]: I thought this was stupid.
[^fn-stupid4]: I thought this was stupid.
[^fn-stupid5]: I thought this was stupid.
[^fn-stupid6]: I thought this was stupid.
[^fn-good]: And it sure as hell felt good as fuck to do that, for the record.
[^fn-cannon]: When she attacked me I hit her with a cannon. This obliterated her body, but the blood was still intelligent.
