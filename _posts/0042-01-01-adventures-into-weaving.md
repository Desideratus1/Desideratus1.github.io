Typically my method of fighting revolves around the use of air magic to give me the ability to teleport into blind spots so I can shoot people. Generally speaking this tactic works against pretty much everything that doesn't outright stop magic, but after some thought I figured that even though teleport-and-shoot works in 90% of all cases, those last 10% should have something to cover them. Specifically I have a blind spot where if guns aren't working, I need to rely on killing magic which is somewhat lacking. That's why I've gotten into Weaving in the Elementalist sense. I've in my possession a number of books on the topic and I've had help from a friend with practical application and practice on the specifics. Said friend provided some interesting "Try these things" suggestions too, and since I haven't written anything down lately I'm going to go ahead and write on this. This will also serve as a vague rant on bullets and magic, so be warned.

## Thoughts on teleportation combined with guns
Let's be honest here, some magic is wildly dangerous and very, very good at killing. But there's a problem with a lot of them in that a good chunk of the killing magic is A: Unreliable against certain targets (Like people that use null fields, Spellbeakers, or generally anything that's lucky enough to have a counter to your stuff) and B: Takes a lot of time, knowledge, and training to get right. Consider high level magic like a longbow. You need some really big muscles and a lot of training to be able to hit targets under pressure. When you get to that point, you've made it but now you also have a very large target on your back. Enter bullets. Anyone can pull a trigger and with enough training (Far less training than needed to become an exceptionally dangerous magic user) you can even get pretty accurate. I don't care who you are, bullets are nasty. If you get shot, it's going to leave a nasty bruise at best, and rip you apart at worst. Even the strongest magical shields in the world will crack if you hit it hard enough, and bullets are really small and hit *really* hard.

So if you have a gun, generally speaking you can expect your offensive capabilities to be handled. What magic should cover defense and mobility, and when we're talking about fighting it's a lot better to avoid being hit with something than to survive being hit so my priority is always to stay mobile over hunkering down. That's where teleporting comes in, because it's the king of mobility. Within limited range I can go anywhere I want very very quickly. Combine the two, and you have married extreme mobility with a solid offense which do not have the same point of failure. Few things could match this and fewer still could match it for efficiency. Weaving doesn't give you anything new with mobility, but what it does do is give you other crap like fire and water and earth along with it. All of these aren't really as useful as a gun but hey, this is for that 10% where guns don't work.

## The Tasks
I'll lay each of these out with the task I was given and what I thought about when I completed them.
### Beginner
*Earth/Water: Create a mud puddle.*
- This could be accomplished by just spraying water everywhere so I had to challenge myself by creating it as quickly as possible. Honestly if I could get this one done quickly the tactical applications, namely concealment and battlefield control might be useful.

*Earth/Fire: Create a molten rock. Can start with coal.*
- This one wasn't too hard, just combine the usual throw rock with some fire. Making it molten was more of a challenge and I question the tactical application but it was a good test to see how I could handle completely marrying two elements together. And like the mud puddle, battlefield control with this is easier to accomplish, as no one wants to step on molten rock.

*Earth/Air: Charge a projectile (or rock gauntlet)*
- This is the one that I think has the most useful offensive application. Not what he has here - though I did accomplish this and it was nice. But rather than charging a rock gauntlet I would use air magic to swing the rock gauntlet really, really hard. Or at that point not even an rock gauntlet, just have a rock spike in front of your knuckles. Merely aim your strike at points of weakness in the armor, such as rivets or better yet unarmored points on the target, and send the rock spike through with the aid of air magic. Most armor would bend or break under such pressure, and flesh and blood would clearly fare even worse.

*Fire/Water: Boil water. Cook egg. Easy mode: steam.*
- I lost like half of my eggs doing this. Sperra got pissed at me and made me go buy more. 0/10.

*Fire/Air: Create a small, contained, fire twister. Introduce lightning strikes. Recommended reading: Intro to Plasma*
- "Into to Plasma" is a cheap imitation of this treatise from the Archives: *Sholl's early investigations into the physics of plasma via Elementalism*. Fire twisters are cool but take a lot to get going and sustain. Lightning strikes being involved is even more draining. Good practice for both Weaving and stamina training but practical applications are niche compared to more direct methods.

*Water/Air: Practice frigid winds. Create a small water spout.*
- Water spouts are just water. Frigid winds are really cool but I need to think more about the practical applications. Freezing things like water to make a bridge is great, but can it be used to really hurt a lot of people in one go?

### Intermediate
*Create a projectile of each dual attunement. Create a close range option for each dual attunement. Create an evade for each dual attunement.*
- There's too much to talk about here but see my thoughts about combining Earth and Air in the Beginner section. Other combinations are fun and interesting but ultimately pale in comparison to hitting someone with a rock really, really hard. Projectiles are still an unknown to me. Needs more though.

*Create plasma by using molten heat with lightning. (DO NOT PRACTICE IN PLAIN CLOTHES)*
- Really fucking dangerous. Normally this would be a great thing but it's also dangerous to the user to an unacceptable degree. To be kept in my "Crazy Bullshit" box for the time being when I need to create something absurdly deadly to everyone including me. I imagine if you did this at a distance in an enclosed space you could do a hell of a lot of damage to everything it touches.

*Create mud slide. Use mud slide to traverse battle.*
- Fun, but teleporting is just better. However, if you'll recall in one of my earlier logs there was a situation where I trapped some centaur in some mud, but it took a hell of a lot of time and water to do. With the advent of this capability I am now in a position to control limited parts of the battlefield, which typically would require much more time and energy.

*Create a meteor out of molten rock. Conjure rock in air and imbue it with fire to release as a projectile.*
- Classic fireball with more blunt impact force. Interesting, but I don't see a huge advantage over pure rock or pure fire. Perhaps using air magic to cause a rock to explode as if it were a grenade would do better?

### Hard
Divide focus to three elements, then four. EXPECT THIS TO BE A SHORT BURST WINDOW. Do not hold focus on each element longer than five seconds at a time, or you WILL BURN YOUR MAGIC THROUGH RESERVE. Release all at once. 
- Absurdly frustrating to maintain. The brief moments when I am able to complete such a process opens a variety of doors, but as we're going for the 10% that is not already covered I don't see anything (As of the writing of this log) that would outdo gunpowder weaponry. More testing is required, however. If one could maintain such a position for an extended of time however, I imagine some truly impressive feats would be achievable.

Expand on range and power of attacks. You can make a tornado, but can you sit in the eye of it and let it carry you?
- In progress. The flexibility which being an Elementalist gives is already second to none, now it goes even further. Range and power naturally are the realm of guns and bullets, but once more we're here for the 10%. While I'm not overly enthused about the possibility of throwing fireballs even further with the aid of air, there is always something to be said about keeping a distance between you and your opponent.
