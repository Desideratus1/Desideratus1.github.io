Quite some time passed as I dealt with the injury dealt to me in that ranch. But, some four months later - with a lot of work and misery - I had my face and eye returned to me. And eventually, with good help came opportunity to delve into a few mysteries.

This particular mystery is the mystery of Keres Wargrave, a Charr who disappeared some 40 years ago in the Halkor Meadows under suspicious circumstances. The Grave warband was operating in the area. Apparently  Wargrave was tasked with guarding recovered bodies, and she was missing on the return of the warband. Where she once was, the ground was soaked with blood and the . Not that long after, Wargrave had shown up at various places, always buying the freedom of (Or some times simply taking) criminals who were never seen again.

This peaked my interest, and I decided to investigate alongside Hisa and Erebus, who had informed me of what was going on. We focused on finding the portal site in Halkor Meadows, and it wasn't long before I discovered a seemingly innocuous pond that was thick with Mists related magic. So we had stumbled onto a possible portal sight. But how to open the portal?

I began an inspection on the ground, aided with earth magic. It wasn't long before I found bodies. Lots of bodies. Older charr and human bodies - probably a mass grave from the wars - and then newer, fresher bodies. One of them, thankfully, was easy to extricate from the bottom of the pond, and a cursory inspection over the mostly rotted cadaver revealed that this unfortunate soul was quite literally butchered. Hacked apart with the intention of spilling as much blood as possible. The hypothesis was easy to make after that. Blood opens the portal.

Eventually we settled on testing that hypothesis. We found/stole a nearby cow, killed it (I kind of feel bad about that), and the portal opened wide with a waterfall of blood that did not stop flowing, though the blood strangely evaporated as it came into Tyria. At first I was elated that my theory was correct, but then immediately gave way to a sensation of welcome. As if I was meant to the portal. That feeling was then also immediately replaced with surprise, as a vicious charr-like amalgamation of bloody pulp exited the portal, and attacked Hisa. Thankfully easy to defeat, but upon its death the portal closes.

Hypothesis confirmed.

The decision was made by Hisa and Erebus to set up a containment area and begin more thorough researching, which I was happy to let them do because it involved far too much bureaucracy for my liking. Instead, I informed them to let me know when a competent team had been assembled to try and enter the portal so I could take part, which occurred not too long after.

There isn't much to discuss in the interim time so I'll skip to the part where we opened the portal and engaged the charr-like creature.

Problem. Capturing the creature was a necessity to ensure that the portal remains open, but it being made up of semi-solid material made the usual tactic of beating it into submission ill advised. Thus, a general solution of somehow trapping it either via fire or ice was implemented. For the most part I was a bystander for this section, and I merely observed as the traps were readied and the creature summoned through thankfully non violent means. Trapping it was a bit of a mess at first, one of our party being gored by the beast before we managed to tie it down and successfully lure/haul it into an ice trap laid by Harpp, an Asura associate of mine. But captured the beast was, and the portal remained open.

Unfortunately my companions decided to fuck around and talk about dumb shit that I didn't bother listening to, so I entered the portal without them after doing some preliminary testing like sticking my rifle through the portal to see if it ate the barrel.

Upon entry, I was greeted with the unexpected sight of a massive, decrepit, and exceedingly old fortress. The portal deposited me in a hallway. From the lefthand passage I heard sounds of blacksmithing. To my right, I heard the sounds of construction. No other entity was with me in the hallway, so I just waited for the rest of my companions to show up. Nothing happened in the interim.

When they finally entered the portal, one of our number was sent to scout to the right-hand corridor, where construction was happening. The information he came back with wasn't too valuable, but it informed us that we should probably go back through the portal and figure out a plan of dealing with this place. Essentially what he saw was a massive tower structure being worked on by crews of prisoners shackled together, with stone gargoyles overlooking them. The more interesting thing was that at the top of the tower, there was a platform suspended by massive chains. Something was hanging off of the platform but he couldn't tell what, given the distance.

"We" came to the decision to retreat, given we didn't know what we were actually up against and running into the middle of hostile territory with no information. Which has never stopped me before, so I convinced Erebus to let me use air magic to allow me to teleport to the platform and see what was up there. He was reluctant, but I didn't care and enacted my plan.

Immediately, the stone gargoyles proved themselves to be home to some hostile blood elementals, though I ignored them on the way up. The platform was my prize, and I certainly got my money's worth.

Upon the platform rested a single humanoid figure with extremely long limbs and six eye sockets that were now devoid of actual eyes. It was bereft of skin, bleeding from its many wounds. Given the amount of blood kind of everywhere I assumed this was the source of it. When I arived at the platform, the figure turned to me and spoke.

"Little spark." It said, in a great, deep voice.

I didn't really have a response to that and I couldn't think of a cool one-liner so I just corrected the creature, saying that my name was Fitzen before teleporting back to ground level. As I did so, I heard the beast roar and the stone gargoyles jumped into action to catch me. I was far too fast for them though, and I returned to the party to usher my companions through before they even got near us.

The gargoyles certainly gave chase to us, but their attempts to follow us through the portal failed, as anything that came through from their end collapsed and became inert. From there, on the assumption of safety, the group split into individuals to do what research we could. There's quite a bit of such research that was done that I don't particularly feel like recounting, so whenever the next chapter is written in regard of this blood tower, I'll made note of the important parts then.
