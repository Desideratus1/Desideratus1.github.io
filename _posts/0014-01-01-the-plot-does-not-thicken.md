At some point following the disaster in the Priory myself and two of my companions, Illy and Harpp, were summoned for a meeting with a Peacemaker officer. We arrived at his office to find Koko and the Order of Whispers agent that saw us through the Rata Sum contract, but no Peacemaker officer. Instead, following not too far behind us was an Arcane Eye agent whose name I think shouldn't be repeated for everyone's safety.
 
Anyway the only thing that happened here was a bunch of talking. We talked a little about the Inquest squads that came after us, a little about next steps, and a little bit of history. The information worth repeating is this: Way back a few years ago Koko was actually an Inquestâ€¦ Operative? Slave? They turned her into a computer. You can look back at the "Murders in Rata Sum'' passage to get an idea of what Koko can do when she wants. This curse and or blessing was granted to her by a not-on-the-public-record Inquest division called Section 11. Long story short they wanted her back pretty badly so we took a hammer to their collective skulls a few times until they stopped bothering us. A lot of their higher ups were wiped out in the process, and as the Eye agent now revealed to us, Section 11 had not disappeared but rather fallen into infighting. Imagine what happens when a tyrannical central government suddenly dies and you're probably not too far off. Somehow these remnants of Section 11 are desperate to take down Mogdraon and mistakenly thought we were cultists in her employ.
 
So that's pretty much it. Inquest "Warlords" we'll call them are connected to Mogdraon and the Eye wants us to deal with them "once and for all" like the last time we dealt with them "once and for all".
