The next few weeks after our foray into the Portal were spent doing heavy research into what the hell any of this is and what it means. I spent my time investigating what the runes on the walls meant and then generally what this blood stuff was about. I'll leave the necessary bits here in summary.

The being at the top of the platform is called "The Jailer". Essentially they rule over the Tower. The Charr creature that attacked us was Keres Wargrave, the current "Warden" - basically the right hand man of the Jailer. The Tower itself is essentially a big prison created by one or several Jotun before or during their collapse into tribalism. The original intent of the Tower was to collect criminals, work them on maintaining the Tower, and then when they inevitably die they would work as spirits until the Jailer consumed the spirit as sustenance. The Jailer and the Tower are linked together in some kind of symbiosis. If one gets hurt the other gets hurt. The left-hand corridor was basically a barracks for the prisoners. Somehow the prisoners are also bound to the Jailer, so getting one/any prisoner out requires the death of the Jailer. Probably. The gargoyle stone guards are gargoyle stone guards.

That all aside eventually we came up with a plan to secure our quarry by the name of Roarke. This plan being that half of us should head down the left-hand corridor to find Roarke, and the other half should head down the right-hand corridor to kill the Jailer. I was part of the kill team.

The other team members were Harpp, an Asura druid, and Tyrone, a human necromancer. The plan was pretty simple: Tyrone would create a distraction using a big and stupid flesh beast to raise hell and pull all the gargoyle stone guard things to the bottom of the tower. The three of us would then race up the tower dodging asshole prisoners along the way, and then confront the Jailer. Harpp did some weird mystic shit to make ice arrows that he ensured me would be effective against it. I didn't believe it whatsoever but that ended up being the only thing we really had. Except me of course.

For once things actually started off well. At least on our end. After separating into our groups, we felt a wave of magic brush over as if something was trying to detect our presence, though each of us reported that they were able to shrug off it off. Don't ask me how you shrug off detection, it just happened. Anyway using this apparently newfound stealth we managed to get to the base of the tower undetected, and observe the stone gargoyle's guarding the bottom floor. It was very likely that more gargoyles were on the upper levels of the scaffolding, so we sent the beast in and just made a run for it, hoping we weren't found out.

The beast did its job well, ramming into stonework and generally raising hell. Gargoyles from the upper level walked off the edges, and slammed into the stone below where they engaged said beast. Its goal of pulling attention, which it did perfectly, and it was assumed it would not survive the encounter.

The way up the tower was filled with spectral prisoners - more than I remembered seeing last time. And now up close, these spirits suddenly had the opportunity to escape their bindings in the form of bodies to take. We managed to avoid them until Tyrone was apprehended by a group of them near the top of the tower. He managed to get out of their grip somehow, but I didn't bother to help him so I can't really say. I think Harpp did. I was too busy confronting the Jailer by that point.

Here's an artist's interpretation of what the Jailer looked like:

You'll note that this differs significantly from what the Jailer was supposed to look like previously. I don't have an explanation for why. Looked a lot more emaciated though.

Somehow it still didn't notice us - probably because of how fucked up it was - and the three of us assembled to strike all at the same time. Which we did! And that went well. Unfortunately at more or less the same time the Jailer noticed Tyrone's presence and attacked him. An arm of pure blood shot out of its core and sandwiched him into the wall as we struck. Harpp's arrows and the shards of ice I launched at it seemed to do a fair amount of damage.

Unfortunately - and here is where things go very, very wrong - it turned out that the Jailer's ability to consume spirits for strength was something it could do at will, which healed it. And there were a lot of spirits in the prison to take from. The Jailer's ability to heal itself meant it could outlast us easily. And then things got even worse when another blood arm hand thing shot out and caught Harpp and smashed him against the wall just as it did to Tyrone. He hit the wall really damn hard too so I wasn't expecting him to be able to free himself either.

At least I managed to dodge the hand coming my way. So there I was, staring an ancient blood monster creature in the face with two of us more or less down for the count. The plan was fucked and at that point I figured I wasn't going to get out of there if I didn't do some crazy bullshit so that's what I did.

So I teleported right next to the Jailer, wherein I could see thin strands of magic that seemed to connect it to its prisoners. That was probably what allowed it to eat the spirits. So I cut at it with my Mists dagger, and thought of a cold, dead winter.

Being in that web of magic and blood was fucking horrifying. I could *feel* the prisoners. I could feel the tower too, each and every stone that made up the entirety of it, surrounded by an endless ocean of blood that felt as though it was once a beautiful landscape. And I could feel pain and misery from the Jailer, searching long for its creator that flayed it and left it here to die.

And I cleaved the motherfucker good and hard, tearing open a ragged hole in reality that  poured out an unbelievable cold. The more importantly I discovered that the portal's ragged appearance was precisely because it acted as a magic sink. Which was great, because all of the magic and blood that the Jailer had been pooling together was very suddenly and very violently being ripped away from it. The immediate effect was catastrophic, and I was able to make a clean getaway. With the same teleportation that brought me there. I put myself to where Harpp was - who was doing pretty badly - and freed him with Tyrone's help by cleaving the arm up.

The Jailer was in its death throes by that point, and its last act was to try to get revenge on me, but I was saved by the intervention of Harpp and Tyrone, who were both a bit worse for wear. Harpp especially.

But either way, the Jailer was dead, and little else of note happened. Except for what appeared to be one half of a card, upon which was written a single phrase in Jotun runes: "The Tower". In the background was a single, lonely tower. The whole thing was charged with magic. My suspicion was that this was the core of the Jailer and what really held the realm together. Unfortunately, I had to leave it behind because it may collapse the realm if it was removed from the realm itself. Sure as hell going to go back and get it later though. Also we didn't find Roarke.
