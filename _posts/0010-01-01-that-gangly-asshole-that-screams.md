The title will become clear soon enough.
 
Some time after the events concerning the undead Svanir, the Errant Coalition was once more summoned to the Shiverpeaks by Ileliana. The meeting was thus.
 
Attendees:
- Plutonk, Asura "Knight"
- Kasielle, Mostly functional Mesmer
- Me
- Gren Geartooth, a tough as nails Charr with a penchant for big scary guns. Also a close friend
- Sif, Norn guardian
- Harpp, Asura Vigil captain (Warmaster is a stupid title and you can fight me over it)
- Several Jotun whose names I neither cared to get or remember
- Illy, Errant Coalition Captain (I refuse to call her Commander cause that's a stupid title)
 
Topics of Discussion:
- Why the fuck are we talking to Jotun
- Who the fuck are the Jotun
- Why the fuck are the Jotun in this situation
 
The essential information to be gathered from the meeting of the Coalition and our new Jotun allies was simple. The first adventure that Kasielle joined the Errant Coalition was chasing some form of specter in the Shiverpeaks that had wiped out a Pact patrol, leaving only one survivor. We now learned that this thing was named the "Death Walker'' by the local Jotun tribes. Apparently, it really was some kind of specter that was kept at bay by a series of Jotun steles. The Jotun we happened upon in the hunt for this creature are of the same tribe of the Jotun we are speaking to now. In simple terms, the Jotun chieftain's son was ambitious, and so sought out power. He fell under Mogdraon's sway, and then forcefully converted and or killed the rest of his clan. The very few that managed to escape were here before us.
 
The plan as I understood it was simple. Hunt down the Death Walker, and kill it. Not particularly imaginative to be honest, but perhaps simplicity was best here. The Jotun chieftain would be our guide. The journey to the location of the Jotun stele previously mentioned took the better part of the day. Nothing of any particular note happened though. We made it to the stele without issue, and the chieftain departed the way we had come, now that his side of the bargain was fulfilled. Before us lay the untamed wilds of the Shiverpeaks.
 
As soon as I crossed the stele, I felt a change. It was as though I was being followed by something. I could tell rather quickly that Kasielle felt the same sort of affect, but none of the rest of the party seemed to take note, so I suppressed the feeling for the time being. What followed was nothing short of the same boring walk that took up the last few hours, until at length we happened upon what looked like a dredge outpost. Deserted, it seemed, as we saw no figures around nor on what would pass for walls amongst the dredge. The outpost lay directly to the south some one hundred meters away. Some seventy-five meters to the south-east lay a sudden, massive rock formation that stretched a fair distance into the sky. The rock formation was where Gren and Kasielle placed themselves. The four of us - Sif, myself, Plutonk, and Harpp entered into the outpost. Or more accurately I stayed outside and everyone else went in.
 
By this point, the disturbance I felt since going past the stele had developed into a voice, telling me to run. The voice was the same voice as the ice cave - still woefully inadequate in its ability to distribute information, but there it was. At first, I felt it behind me, panicked assuming it was the thing we were hunting, and fired my revolver. For the sake of clarity, I had not drawn the revolver when I fired it. I grabbed the revolver, desperately tried to maneuver it inside its holster, and fired it into the ground. Thankfully this was what I wanted, and not some pointless expense of ammunition. The bullet that was of Sperra's make; And when it struck the ground, a null field some ten meters in diameter appeared on the point of impact. I knew fairly quickly afterwards - mostly because of the irritated yells of my companions - that I had without question fucked up. I played it off as something incredibly serious, and was told to enter the outpost to remove the top layer of snow inside the courtyard of said outpost.
 
I did so, and revealed the bodies of dredge. Their faces seemed to be frozen in horror, and several of them seemed to have turned on each other in their last moments. Great. It was then that were alerted by a horrid yell of a monstrous creature somewhere even further south than the outpost. Gren and Kasielle alerted us. The voice told me once more to run, but the four of us exited to find the source of the noise closing in on us. I and Sif, upon viewing the creature, were paralyzed with felt like an extreme sensation of fear. The creature itself was exceptionally tall. One half-meter above Sif, as far as I could reckon at the time. Its limbs were lanky, long and twisted as if some unknown mutilation had occurred. Its skin was a pale white, and where its face was there were no eyes; Only pits that sank deep into the skull. Its cry was a solid, mournful wail. I swore I could make out words, but never determined what they could have been.
 
Regardless, I was picked up by Harpp immediately. Breaking eye contact seemed to snap me out of my daze, but the attempt to break Sif from its grasp and get her away from it failed spectacularly. The portal that appeared under her - which I assumed to be Kasielle's doing - ended up planting Sif - still paralyzed - right in front of the monster. It grabbed her, and began its mournful wail as it stared into her eyes. The Coalition poured everything it had into the creature. I saw bullets strike against its chest and bounce off with little effect. Magic crashed against the body and did next to nothing. Arrows, rocks. Unphased in its entirety. Sif however, fared not so much better. By virtue of being in the line of fire she took off-kilter shots and poorly aimed strikes against the beast, still locked in its hands. Until, thankfully, I managed a quick teleportation to the beast.
 
I cut at its hands, and promptly teleported back to the location I just came from. Sif's head was not unscathed in the matter but I considered it a necessary cost. The beast dropped her, which I assume was in surprise rather than pain. Another portal was opened by Kasielle, and by this point the catatonic Sif was teleported onto the rock formation. By pure luck, we then managed a hasty retreat. Meanwhile the voice was going on about how we should run - that we can't kill this thing - that we should run to the Jotun stele that supposedly kept it at bay.
 
In short order - partially on the suggestion what I screamed out as "The fucking voice in my head" - the Coalition made its way to the stele. It seemed that the legend was true; We were not followed past that point. From here, we healed what wounds we could, being unable to bring Sif out of her apparent stupor, and headed back to the safety of civilization. The myriad of mysteries that were created from this are, as of this point, unanswered.
