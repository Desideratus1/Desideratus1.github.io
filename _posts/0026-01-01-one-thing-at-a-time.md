Calypso put me on probation because they didn't trust me and I didn't trust them so I quit.

Onto more recent business the Coalition was made active once again at the behest of Sheska and Plutonk, who were wandering around or some shit and stumbled on a human settlement by the name of \<name\>ton. No that's not me forgetting to overwrite something, I'll talk about that more later. This human town was plagued by bandits, centaur, and weird ominous dreams that tripped their "Not normal" alarms. The problems were so great, in fact, that the town was in rather dire straits and Sheska and Plutonk decided that they couldn't handle it on their own.

The town itself was very far into the hinterlands east of Divinity's Reach. Not so far that it's next to Drizzlewood but you're within walking distance to the Shiverpeaks and there is not a waypoint in sight. The Seraph would obviously be of little help here, given the settlement is so far away. Thus it relies on its own underequipped militia and various adventurers to ourselves.

After a good long trek through the woods, getting lost plenty of times in this shitty region of the world I at length arrived to \<name\>ton and soon found myself standing at the gate to the settlement with Plutonk. The guards were staring at an assembled crew of me, Sheska, Plutonk, an Asura named Sneazz, and some asshole human who's name I forget. We'll call him Dilbert. There was a lot of talking but the gist of it was that the aforementioned centaur, bandits, and dreams were threatening to overrun the town and that's a bad thing. To make matters even worse most of these humans have probably not seen very many Charr or Asura in their lives, so we definitely got stared at and what information we were able to pry from these people is as follows.

So the important bits are that the town's founder was an impoverished noble by the name of Edgar. The town was named Edgarton. And then Edgar got ousted in a coup led by a guy named Brock and the town was named Brockton. Brock has people and weapons at his back so it's not like the actual residents of the town have a real in say in who runs the place so that's a problem we'll need to look into later. For the most part I don't particularly care - I consider it my job to defend people that need defending, and Brock hasn't done anything particularly egregious to the townsfolk so I'm not too interested in dealing with political coups.

The Church's priest however, was a pretty decent person whom we could actually get some information out of but didn't know much. He pointed us to where one of his friend priests and his companion Norn named Odis, who were nearby the town in what seemed like an old prayer circle surrounded by the gods' statues. Apparently they were trying to put Odis into a dream to confront the dream but it didn't work, and lacking any other options we just sort of went along with that. The first problem to solve would apparently be the dreams plaguing the town nonstop for the past few days. We talked a little with Odis and his friend who had previously attempted to induce Odis into a lucid dream to confront the creature, though for whatever Odis failed to defeat the creature in the dream.

So me, Sheska, and Sneazz went into the dream instead. I wish I had more to talk about here but I honestly don't. There was a monster in the dream, the mechanics of the dream were strange and I didn't get to investigate too hard before we killed the monster. Then we woke up. Back in real life apparently there was a monster there too but everyone else killed it before I could really do anything. The current theory is that the creature - who in the dream appeared to be a large Shade like what you would get from Grenth's realm and who is real life was invisible but vaguely humanoid - was a creature from the realm of Torment. I can't really talk about Torment with any authority so you're free to draw your own conclusions as to how the hell it got here and what it was even doing.

So that was that. The dreams might be fixed but Sheska suspects the Torment monster was summoned rather than a random occurrence. I'm not sure what exactly to believe, but either way the dreams were at least temporarily fixed and we went back to the Priest to inform him of our immediate success.
