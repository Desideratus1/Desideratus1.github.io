So after we fixed the dreams, we went to fix the centaur and or bandit problem.

The centaurs had been for the last however long harassing the farmers in the fields. The town's militia was definitely In a sorry state. They had a couple more modern rifles, but a lot of them were relying on older flintlock muskets, spears, and swords. While this isn't catastrophically bad - flintlocks are better than nothing - They're up against centaur who are faster and apparently just as well armed as they are - what's more the centaur stick around in the fields, which is the perfect ground for cavalry. Which Centaur are. The odds are stacked heavily against the militia, so the best tactic the farmers have at their disposal is to run. You can imagine how that goes.

Ignoring the catastrophic problems with the strategy of leaving the farmers to die, the Coalition and myself - the same people from the last time - decided to fix this problem next.
Sneazz and Albrecht? I think his name is? Decided to scout on the edges of the field while I stood on top of the tallest structure in the fields I could find, which was a very overengineered water… Sprayer… Thing. Apparently it was broken. I probably could have fixed it if I cared to but I was pretty busy at the time.

I spent the next few minutes just observing the tree line beyond the fields, which was about a kilometer or so from my position on the sprayer. Nothing happened for a good long while, but eventually I caught note of a human man skulking around the tree line, trailing Albrecht and Sneazz. He was clothed in blue, and had a billhook on his back. The blue was more or less the same color as I saw in some still standing heraldry in the town, so I figured this person was loyal to Edgar, which implies to me that the "bandits" are actually Edgar's loyalists. There wasn't much I could do at the moment and upon informing Plutonk of the discovery he said to "fire a warning shot at him if he goes after Sneazz of Albrecht". I informed him that warning shots are stupid and I would shoot to kill instead. He didn't like this.

A few more minutes pass. I got pretty bored until at last, I spotted a torch light up in the tree lines not too far from where the bandit was. And in the field itself was Albrecht, blazing with a hell of a lot of light. I immediately recognized that the tree line torch wielder was a centaur, and screamed at Plutonk before opening fire. Plutonk immediately rushed head, while I stayed back to look for any other centaur groups and provide some amount of cover fire. Unfortunately the melee started pretty quickly and it was absolute chaos, so providing cover was impossible and after a few seconds of looking I saw no other parties and joined the fray.

Which meant teleporting an entire kilometer, which was not fun but I managed to do with some chain teleporting - a skill I've been slowly trying to develop so I can move around long distances without frying myself.

I arrived on the right flank where Sneazz had just been ensnared in vines, while two Centaur were nearby him. One was a magic user - probably the one ensnaring him - and the other had a rifle they were reloading. The ensnaring was bad, but if that rifle reloaded then someone was probably going to die so I ended my teleportation run to put myself just behind and above the skull of the rifle wielder, and split their head in two with my sword. Next I rounded on Sneazz's ensnarer, and put a few bullets into him with my revolver before moving to help the rest of the party.

Apparently they didn't need my help because Albrecht and Plutonk mopped the damn floor with them all. The centaur were demolished, no contest. But soon after, I remembered the bandit, and teleported once more to where I remembered him to be. And there he was, the bright blue bandit, sitting in a tree with a gun pointed at him.

Thankfully he chose to see reason, disarmed himself at my demand, and then climbed down the tree very slowly. I wasn't really that interested in anything he had to say all things considered, but my theory about him being an Edgar loyalist ended up being true and we were given instructions to meet at an "Evertree" - apparently an old shrine to Melandru - at night for some negotiations. Whatever the hell that means. I decided to go back into town and not attend this negotiation for my own sanity.
